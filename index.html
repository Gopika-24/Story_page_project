<p>Krishna is a major Hindu god. Often called Lord Krishna, he is one of the most widely worshiped and popular Hindu deities. Krishna is the eighth avatar (or incarnation) of Vishnu. He was deified in the 5th century and since then has also been worshiped as the supreme god himself. Krishna is the Hindu god of compassion, protection, and love. Also called the Dark One, Krishna is an important character in many Hindu sacred texts, including the Bhagavad Gita. He is portrayed in various ways in Indian mythology and art, from child-god to divine lover, prankster to hero. However, there are three main stages of incarnation within the story of Krishna: the baby, the lover, and the sage. These three stages are believed to symbolize key aspects of his significance and power within Hindu mythology.
    Krishna is known by 108 different names and emanations, many of which reflect his attributes and mythological associations. The name Krishna itself means black or dark blue. Some of his more popular epithets are Mohan, the enchanter, Govinda, the chief herdsman, Keev, the prankster. Some epithets and names are used only in specific geographical locations. One example is Jagannatha, a name popular in the Odisha state region of India. The honorary title Sri is often placed before the name Krishna, meaning Lord.

  <p>The Avatar of Krishna is said to have taken place in Dwapara Yuga (a time period dating back to thousands of years). Very elaborate holy mythologies (Srimad Bhagavatam, Brahma Vaivarta Purana and Mahabharata) are available in Hindu scripture which contain the wonderful life history and details of the divine play enacted by Lord Krishna.His attraction to devotees is magnetic. He is ever joyful; He is the preacher of Karma Yoga (the path for unification with God through work without attachment) and he is a perfect Karma Yogi himself, performing work ceaselessly all through his life with joyous detachment and abandonment, seeking no fruits of his actions for himself. It is with this practical authority that he delivered discourse to his disciple and close friend Arjuna on the eve of a grand Mahabharata war is Bhagavat Gita — one of the greatest scriptures of Hinduism; it is a philosophical treasure very widely read and adored by people across the world, cutting across religious barriers.</p>
  <h2>Birth Of Shri Krishna</h2>

  <p>Sri Krishna was born in northern India in approximately 3,228 BCE. The Puranas consider Sri Krishna’s life to mark the passing of the Dvapara age into the Kali Yuga (current age) Baby_thief_KrishnaKrishna was born in prison to devout parents – Devaki and Vasudeva. At the time of his birth, his life was in danger because the tyrant Kamsa was seeking to kill him. It had been foretold that Kamsa would be killed by Devaki’s eighth child. Since Sri Krishna was the eighth child, he was smuggled out of prison to be raised by his foster parents Nanda and Yasoda in Gokula. Nanda lived a simple lifestyle and was a chief in the local Cow-herding community. The young Sri Krishna is often depicted in these days as being a mischievous child, who enjoyed playing pranks and having fun. Some worship Sri Krishna as the ideal child of innocence.However, even in his young years, Krishna is reported to have killed demons Trinavarta and Putana. He is also said to have lifted a nearby hill – Govardhana to protect the villagers against the wrath of Indra.</p>

    <h2>Sri Krishna And Bhagavad Gita </h2>

    <p>On his return to Mathura, Sri Krishna killed his uncle Kansa – after Kansa had tried several times to have Krishna killed.In Mathura, he befriended the Pandava Prince Arjuna. Sri Krishna became a counsel and friend to Arjuna.The Kurukshetra war was a battle between the Pandavas and Kauravas (led by King Dhritarashtra). Despite the provocations of the Kauravas, Sri Krishna tried to mediate to avoid a conflict. He asked the Kauravas to give the Pandavas just a small amount of land. However, Dhritarashtra refused any compromise.  Once war became inevitable, Sri Krishna offered a choice to his dearest friend Arjuna – either he could choose Sri Krishna himself, or he could choose Krishna’s armies. Arjuna chose the counsel of Sri Krishna rather than his armies.
      Sri-krishna_use_weaponIt was on the battlefield of Kurukshetra that Sri Krishna gave the immortal dialogue of the Bhagavad Gita, which was an exposition of Sri Krishna’s yoga and how an aspiring seeker might seek union with God. Unlike Indian scriptures of the past, the Bhagavad Gita did not require world renunciation but encouraged world acceptance. The Bhagavad Gita and the life of Sri Krishna were very important for making spirituality accessible to ordinary people – and not just yogi’s who renounced the world. The central message of Sri Krishna was for man to take part in desireless action – motivated not by human ego, but for the Divine Cause.</p>

  <h2>Radha and Krishna</h2>
<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSxOhfNyy_wuEfOPst8LimWpEAdo5fN3RDSog&usqp=CAU" alt =""height="150px",width="350px" align="right">
  <P>Lord Radha and goddess Radha are inseparable; They always come together as one name Radha Krishna. The name Lord Krishna is derived from the Sanskrit word Krishna, which is primarily an adjective meaning "black", "blue", "dark blue" or "all-attractive". It is believed to have eight incarnations of Lord Vishnu. He is probably the most popular of all the heroes of Hindu mythology. The word Radha means the greatest lover and worshiper of Krishna. Shri Radha is the feminine aspect of Shri Krishna and is not separate from Krishna.

    The entanglement of Radha-Krishna was such a pure and cutest love story Radha-Krishna love has always been a source of inspiration for the Bhakti movement of Vaishnavaites (worshipers of Vishnu) of eastern India as this love symbolically represents the longing for “yoga” (union) of the individual soul with the Supreme soul.

    According to Brahma Vaivartha Purana, Krishna is considered the Paramatma (Chidatma) and Radha his Chit Sakthi.  He is the creator-Sustainer-Distructor of the Universe and he is verily tha Brahman (Ultimate God).  He is not considered as an Avatar of Vishnu unlike other Purnas.</P>

    <h2>The Child Krishna Brought up at Gokula</h2>
   <center><img src="https://hinduismwayoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/krishna-baby-escaping-yasoda.jpg" alt ></center>
    <p>The baby Lord Krishna grew up joyfully in the company of cow herds at Gokula. He was dark skinned and was the most beautiful and charming boy of the community. Whoever came across him fell in instant love with him. He was full of childhood pranks. He loved to steal butter and eat it in the company of fellow cow herd boys. He became the prince charming for all the young girls and women folk (Gopis) of the community.In the meanwhile, Kamsa sent several powerful demons in varying disguises to search for, locate and kill the boy-who-escaped from the prison. Little Krishna encountered all of them (Putana, Sakatasura, Bakasura, Trinavarta, Vatsasura, Aghasura etc) and killed them all as a matter of child play</p>
    <p>Krishna is the embodiment of love, affection, knowledge and intelligence and Radha is the female manifestation of all these traits. If Krishna is the Sun, Radha is the Sunlight. If Krishna is powerful Radha is the shakti behind. His sincere love and dedication has kept him alive in our hearts, his love story etched with admiration for ages. Radha and Krishna love story encapsulates the love that exists in the universe and that is why it is popular as the most powerful and mythological love story in this modern world as well. Their love is like a blowing wind. Which will be fluttering in the air forever and ever.</p>



  <h2>The Kurukshetra War And The Birth Of Bhagawad Gita</h2>
 <center> <img src="https://hinduismwayoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Krishna-Arjuna.jpg" alt></center>
  <p>Finally a grand war erupted between Padndavas and Kouravas. Numerous kings of the entire subcontinent virtually sidelined and supported either Pandavas or Kauravas according to their relationships and temperament and took part in the great Mahabharata war. Dharma was obviously on the side of Pandavas. Krishna, as the king of Mathura and a blood relative of both Pandavas and Kouravas, offered his entire army to take part in the war on one side and he himself without taking-up arms on the other side. He left the choice to Arjuna (of the Pandavas) and Duryodanan (of Kouravas) to choose any one between the two. While Arjuna instantly and gladly opted to have Krishna on their side as a non-fighting companion, Duryodanan was too happy to accept the huge and powerful army of Krishna. Krishna offered his services to be the charioteer of Arjuna during the war.

    Just before the beginning of the war at Kurukshetra, Arjuna became jittery. He felt it was futile to wage war against his own blood relations and other seniors, respectable elders and teachers and masters in the opposite camp. It was at this juncture, that Lord Krishna gave one of the greatest sermons to Arjuna. His utterances form the holy scripture Bhagavat Gita. In this great spiritual discourse, Lord Krishna predominantly teaches Karma Yoga – the path of attaining the greatest goal of life though self-less action by surrendering all the fruits of actions at the feet of lord. In Bhagavad Gita, he also elaborates the other spiritual paths — Bhakti Yoga and Gnyana Yoga.
    <p><b><i>“There are four very great events in history, the siege of Troy, the life and crucifixion of Christ, the exile of Krishna in Brindavan and the colloquy with Arjuna on the field of Kurukshetra. The siege of Troy created Hellas, the exile in Brindavan created devotional religion (for before there was only meditation and worship), Christ from his cross humanised Europe, the colloquy at Kurukhetra will yet liberate humanity.”</b></i></p>

    <h2>The End Of Krishna</h2>
  <center><img src="https://hinduismwayoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/yadavas-infighting-450x562.jpg" alt align=""height="350px",width="250px"</center>
    <p>As Krishna advanced in age, the Yadava clan grew too arrogant, morally weak and got in the grip of vices. By an act of mischief, Krishna’s descendants and their clan got a curse from sages that paved for their annihilation. Lots of bickering happened between the members of families and the ruling class and they grew out of control of Krishna’s divine and moral influence. Time soon came when they were destined to get wiped out entirely on account of a verbal dual that started between two drunken relatives of Krishna. It grew into a bloody fight and Krishna took up the role of a destroyer now and he personally killed many yadavas using pestles that grew out of wild grass near seashore.

      Krishna knew that it was time to draw curtains to his divine plays in his present Avatar. He retired to forest and was engaged in deep meditation. He was finally slain by an arrow which was mistakenly aimed at his foot by a hunter who thought it was a deer.</p>

    <p>Soon a great tsunami came and the surging sea waters submerged the entire city of Dwaraka.

        Krishna’s entire life was one of an exuberant display of divine play. Krishna’s childhood life at Gokula and Vrindavan where he became the very soul of all the lives of Gopas and Gopis and his divine love with Radha continues to be the source of inspiration of Bhakti movment for the Vaishnavites.
        
        Krishna’s Bhagavat Gita reins as a supreme reference book of all the various paths of Yoga (Karma, Bhakti, Gnyana and Raja Yoga) for earnest seekers of Hinduism for guidance and enlightenment.</p>
